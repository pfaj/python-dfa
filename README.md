# Python DFA Implementation
I wrote a DFA (Deterministice Finite Automata) in python. It uses a 
graph like structure to build and traverse the DFA to validate languages based on the DFA
created in main.

In the current main I have created a language that accepts 

{a<sup>n</sup>, b<sup>m</sup> | n,m > 0; where it starts and ends with b}

Below is an image representation of what this looks like.

Feel free to download and mess with the code.
